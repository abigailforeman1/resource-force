    "description": "A charged and necessary wake-up call to pervasive, institutionalised racism, Eddo-Lodge\u2019s searing polemic reconstitutes the frame of the argument around race, removing it from the hands of those with little experience of its resonances. From ambient and lazy cultural stereotyping to open hostility, Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race is a clarion call of understanding.",
